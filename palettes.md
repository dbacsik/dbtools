Hex: "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F5C710", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#999999"

# Bacsik Bright
I quickly made this for a modern, bright palette I can use for data exploration. It was based off of [this one at Muzli](https://colors.muz.li/palette/072448/54d2d2/ffcb00/f8aa4b/ff6150). I modified it and adjusted it on [VizPalette](https://projects.susielu.com/viz-palette)
